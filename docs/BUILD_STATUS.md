## Packages with Issues

### nevil_interfaces_ai
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Issue**: The AI interface node was not being found during launch.
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. The entry point in setup.py incorrectly included the ".py" extension
  2. The import path in setup.py was incorrect
  3. The launch file was referencing the executable with the ".py" extension
- **Resolution**:
  1. Fixed the entry point in setup.py by removing the ".py" extension and updating the import path:
     ```python
     'ai_interface_node = nevil_interfaces_ai.scripts.ai_interface_node:main',
     ```
  2. Updated the launch file to use the correct executable name without the ".py" extension:
     ```python
     ld.add_action(Node(
         package='nevil_interfaces_ai',
         executable='ai_interface_node',
         name='ai_interface',
         output='screen',
     ))
     ```

## Build Process Notes
- The ROS 2 launch system requires executable scripts to be properly registered as entry points in the package's setup.py file.
- Entry points should not include the ".py" extension.
- Launch files should reference executables without the ".py" extension.
- Python modules referenced in entry points must be properly importable (part of a Python package with __init__.py files).

## Next Steps
1. Verify that all packages build successfully by running the build_all_packages.sh script.
2. Test the full system launch to ensure all nodes start correctly.
3. Check for any other packages that might have similar issues with executable scripts.
