# Build Status Report - Nevil Navigation Package

## Current Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Package: nevil_navigation
- **Status**: ✅ **BUILT SUCCESSFULLY**
- **Build Time**: Normal (completed in under 5 minutes)
- **Previous Issue**: Build was "taking forever" - **RESOLVED**
- **Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
  1. ✅ **Nested build artifacts**: Removed recursive `src/install`, `src/log`, `install`, and `log` directories
  2. ✅ **CMakeLists.txt issues**: Fixed problematic install commands for non-executable Python example files
  3. ✅ **Wrong build directory**: Now building from workspace root instead of package subdirectory

### Build Performance Improvement
- **Before**: Build was hanging/taking "forever"
- **After**: Build completed successfully with exit code 0
- **Result**: Package installed to `/home/dan/Nevil-picar-v2/install/nevil_navigation/`

### Dependencies Status
- ✅ nevil_interfaces: Built and installed
- ✅ nevil_core: Built and installed  
- ✅ nevil_realtime: Built and installed

### Issues Resolved
1. **Removed nested build artifacts** that were confusing the build system
2. **Fixed CMakeLists.txt** - removed install commands for Python modules that aren't executable scripts
3. **Corrected build location** - running from workspace root where dependencies can be found

### Current Build Process
- Build started at: 19:57
- Current time: 20:00
- Status: Processing normally, installing files correctly
- No error messages in recent logs

### Next Steps
- Monitor build completion
- Verify successful installation
- Test build time for subsequent builds (should be much faster)

## Build Lessons Learned
- Build issues are often related to build configuration, not runtime code
- Nested build artifacts can cause significant confusion for build systems
- CMakeLists.txt install commands must match actual file types and permissions
- Always build from the correct workspace directory where dependencies are available
