      "type": "Bug",
      "summary": "system_monitor executable not found in libexec directory",
      "description": "The ROS2 launch system is unable to find the system_monitor executable in the expected location: '/home/dan/nevil/src/install/nevil_bringup/lib/nevil_bringup'.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n- The system_monitor.py script exists in the source directory (~/nevil/src/nevil_bringup/scripts/system_monitor.py)\n- However, it's not being installed to the lib directory during the build process\n- Only nevil_cli.py is being installed, despite the CMakeLists.txt file specifying both scripts\n\n**Current Workaround:**\n- Modified the launch file to use ExecuteProcess instead of Node\n- This bypasses the need for the executable to be in the lib directory\n- Directly runs the Python script from its source location\n\n**Pros of ExecuteProcess Approach:**\n- Simplicity: Directly executes the script without installation requirements\n- Flexibility: Can run scripts from any location, not just installed locations\n- Development Friendly: Easier to test changes without rebuilding/reinstalling\n- No Build Dependencies: Works regardless of build system configuration\n- Quick Fix: Immediate solution without modifying build files\n\n**Cons of ExecuteProcess Approach:**\n- Non-Standard: Doesn't follow ROS2 best practices\n- Limited Lifecycle Management: Doesn't integrate with ROS2 node lifecycle\n- Manual Parameter Handling: Parameters must be passed as command-line arguments\n- Namespace Issues: May require manual namespace configuration\n- Resource Management: Less controlled termination and cleanup\n\n**Permanent Solution Options:**\n1. Fix the build system to properly install system_monitor.py to the lib directory\n2. Create a proper entry point in setup.py for the system_monitor script",

The rt_motor_control_node.py file contains a comment: \"In a real implementation, this would use the RTHardwareInterface with proper mutex handling\", but this interface is not implemented.\n\n**Impact:**\n- The system cannot control the physical robot despite documentation claiming this functionality\n- The Picarx class and robot_hat library are available but not integrated into the codebase\n- Core functionality described in the architecture documentation is not implemented\n\n**Required Implementation:**\n1. Create RTHardwareInterface class that interfaces with the robot_hat library\n2. Implement methods for motor control, servo control, and sensor reading\n3. Integrate with the existing hardware abstraction layer\n4. Update the rt_motor_control_node.py to use the RTHardwareInterface\n5. Test with the physical PiCar-X robot",

      "summary": "Separate Voice Control Node from AI Processing Node",
      "description": "Currently, the Voice Control Node (N5) functionality is embedded within the `nevil_interfaces_ai` package, which doesn't align with the architectural design specified in `docs/Nevil_v2.0_Architectural_Overview.md`. The architecture specifies that the Voice Control Node (N5) should be separate from the AI Processing Node (N6).\n\n**Tasks:**\n\n1. Create a new package `nevil_voice_control` to contain all voice-related functionality:\n   - Move `speech_recognition_node.py` to the new package\n   - Move `speech_synthesis_node.py` to the new package\n   - Move voice-specific parts of `dialog_manager_node.py` to the new package\n   - Move `audio_hardware_interface.py` to the new package\n\n2. Update the interfaces between packages:\n   - Define clear message interfaces between `nevil_voice_control` and `nevil_interfaces_ai`\n   - Ensure proper topic/service/action definitions for cross-package communication\n\n3. Update launch files and dependencies:\n   - Update package.xml with appropriate dependencies\n   - Create launch files for the voice control nodes\n   - Update existing launch files that reference the moved nodes\n\n4. Testing:\n   - Test voice recognition functionality after the move\n   - Test speech synthesis functionality after the move\n   - Test integration with AI processing\n\nThis refactoring will bring the implementation in line with the architectural design, creating a cleaner separation of concerns between voice control and AI processing.",
