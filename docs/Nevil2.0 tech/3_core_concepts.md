## ROS2 Architecture

### What is ROS2?

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### Key ROS2 Concepts

#### Nodes

Nodes are processes that perform computation. In Nevil-picar v2.0, each major function is implemented as a separate node:

- Motion Control Node
- Obstacle Avoidance Node
- Navigation Node
- Camera Vision Node
- Voice Control Node
- AI Processing Node
- System Manager Node

#### Topics

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. In Nevil-picar v2.0, topics are used for continuous data streams like:

- `/cmd_vel`: Velocity commands
- `/ultrasonic_data`: Distance sensor readings
- `/camera/image_raw`: Raw camera images
- `/object_detections`: Detected objects
- `/system_mode`: Current system mode

#### Services

Services are request/response interactions between nodes. In Nevil-picar v2.0, services are used for discrete operations like:

- `/check_obstacle`: Check if an obstacle is present
- `/translate_command`: Convert natural language to system commands
- `/query_capabilities`: Get information about system capabilities

#### Actions

Actions are for longer tasks that provide feedback during execution. In Nevil-picar v2.0, actions are used for complex operations like:

- `/navigate_to_point`: Navigate to a specific location
- `/perform_behavior`: Execute an expressive behavior
- `/process_dialog`: Handle a conversation

#### Parameters

Parameters are configuration values for nodes. In Nevil-picar v2.0, parameters control behavior like:

- Motion control speeds and limits
- Obstacle avoidance thresholds
- Camera settings
- Voice recognition parameters

### ROS2 Launch System

The launch system in ROS2 allows multiple nodes to be started with specific configurations. Nevil-picar v2.0 uses launch files to start the entire system with appropriate parameters and node priorities.

Example launch file:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='nevil_core',
            executable='system_manager_node',
            name='system_manager',
            parameters=[{'param1': 'value1'}]
        ),
        Node(
            package='nevil_navigation',
            executable='motion_control_node',
            name='motion_control',
            parameters=[{'max_speed': 0.5}]
        ),
        # Additional nodes...
    ])
```

## Multi-Threading with PREEMPT-RT

### What is PREEMPT-RT?

PREEMPT-RT is a set of patches for the Linux kernel that allows for better real-time performance. It makes the kernel fully preemptible, which means that high-priority tasks can interrupt lower-priority tasks, even if the lower-priority task is executing kernel code.

### MultiThreadedExecutor

ROS2 provides a MultiThreadedExecutor that allows multiple callbacks to be executed concurrently. Nevil-picar v2.0 uses this executor to run multiple nodes in parallel, enabling true concurrent processing.

```python
def main():
    rclpy.init()
    
    # Create nodes
    motion = MotionControl()
    obstacle = ObstacleAvoidance()
    navigation = Navigation()
    vision = CameraVision()
    voice = VoiceControl()
    ai = AIProcessing()
    system = SystemManager()

    # Create and configure executor
    executor = MultiThreadedExecutor()
    executor.add_node(motion)
    executor.add_node(obstacle)
    executor.add_node(navigation)
    executor.add_node(vision)
    executor.add_node(voice)
    executor.add_node(ai)
    executor.add_node(system)

    # Spin the executor
    try:
        executor.spin()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

    # Cleanup
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

### Priority-Based Scheduling

Nevil-picar v2.0 uses priority-based scheduling to ensure that critical tasks are executed with minimal latency. Nodes are assigned priorities based on their importance:

| Node | Priority | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Motion Control | 90 | Direct hardware control, requires low latency |
| Obstacle Avoidance | 85 | Safety-critical, must respond quickly |
| Navigation | 80 | Path planning and execution |
| Camera Vision | 70 | Visual processing |
| Voice Control | 60 | User interaction |
| AI Processing | 50 | Complex reasoning |
| System Manager | 40 | Overall coordination |

These priorities are implemented using the `chrt` command:

```bash
sudo chrt -f 90 ros2 run nevil_core motion_control_node
```

### Real-Time Performance Metrics

Nevil-picar v2.0 aims to meet specific latency requirements for critical operations:

- Obstacle detection and avoidance: < 50ms
- Motion control command execution: < 20ms
- Voice command recognition: < 1s
- System mode switching: < 500ms

These metrics are monitored and logged to ensure consistent performance.

## Node Structure and Communication

### Node Organization

Nevil-picar v2.0 organizes nodes into three priority levels:

#### High Priority Nodes

- **Motion Control Node**: Controls the motors and servos for movement
- **Obstacle Avoidance Node**: Processes sensor data to detect and avoid obstacles

#### Medium Priority Nodes

- **Navigation Node**: Handles path planning and execution
- **Camera Vision Node**: Processes camera input for object detection and tracking

#### Lower Priority Nodes

- **Voice Control Node**: Manages speech recognition and synthesis
- **AI Processing Node**: Handles AI processing and decision-making
- **System Manager Node**: Coordinates overall system behavior and mode switching

### Communication Patterns

Nodes communicate using several patterns:

#### Publisher-Subscriber

Used for continuous data streams:

```python
# Publisher example
self.publisher = self.create_publisher(Twist, 'cmd_vel', 10)
msg = Twist()
msg.linear.x = 0.5
self.publisher.publish(msg)

# Subscriber example
self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
    Twist,
    'cmd_vel',
    self.cmd_vel_callback,
    10)
```

#### Service Client-Server

Used for request-response interactions:

```python
# Service server example
self.srv = self.create_service(
    CheckObstacle,
    'check_obstacle',
    self.check_obstacle_callback)

# Service client example
self.client = self.create_client(CheckObstacle, 'check_obstacle')
request = CheckObstacle.Request()
future = self.client.call_async(request)
```

#### Action Client-Server

Used for long-running tasks with feedback:

```python
# Action server example
self._action_server = ActionServer(
    self,
    NavigateToPoint,
    'navigate_to_point',
    self.execute_callback)

# Action client example
self._action_client = ActionClient(self, NavigateToPoint, 'navigate_to_point')
goal_msg = NavigateToPoint.Goal()
self._action_client.send_goal_async(goal_msg)
```

### Interface Definitions

Nevil-picar v2.0 defines custom interfaces for communication between nodes:

#### Messages

```
# SystemStatus.msg
uint8 NORMAL = 0
uint8 WARNING = 1
uint8 ERROR = 2

uint8 status
string message
```

#### Services

```
# CheckObstacle.srv
float32 direction
---
bool obstacle_present
float32 distance
```

#### Actions

```
# NavigateToPoint.action
# Goal
float32 x
float32 y
float32 theta
---
# Result
bool success
string message
---
# Feedback
float32 distance_remaining
float32 estimated_time_remaining
```

## Hardware Abstraction Layer

### Purpose

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides a consistent interface to hardware components, allowing the same code to run on both physical hardware and in simulation.

### Implementation

The HAL is implemented as a set of classes that provide hardware-specific functionality:

```python
class HardwareInterface:
    def __init__(self, simulation_mode=False):
        self.simulation_mode = simulation_mode
        if simulation_mode:
            self.interface = SimulationInterface()
        else:
            self.interface = PhysicalHardwareInterface()
    
    def set_motor_speed(self, left, right):
        return self.interface.set_motor_speed(left, right)
    
    def get_distance(self):
        return self.interface.get_distance()
    
    def get_camera_image(self):
        return self.interface.get_camera_image()
```

### Hardware Components

The HAL provides interfaces for the following hardware components:

- **Motors**: Control the wheel motors for movement
- **Servos**: Control the steering and camera servos
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measure distance to obstacles
- **Camera**: Capture images for vision processing
- **Microphone**: Capture audio for voice recognition
- **Speaker**: Output audio for voice synthesis
- **IMU**: Measure orientation and acceleration

## Digital Twin Simulation

### What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. In Nevil-picar v2.0, the digital twin provides a simulated environment for development and testing without requiring physical hardware.

### Simulation Components

#### URDF Model

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) model defines the physical properties of the robot:

```xml
<robot name="picar_x">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.2 0.15 0.05"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.2 0.15 0.05"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="1.0"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.01" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.01" iyz="0.0" izz="0.01"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>
  <!-- Additional links and joints -->
</robot>
```

#### Physics Simulation

The physics simulation models the dynamics of the robot and its environment, including:

- Motion dynamics
- Collision detection
- Friction and inertia
- Gravity and other forces

#### Sensor Simulation

The sensor simulation provides virtual sensor data that mimics the behavior of physical sensors:

- Ultrasonic sensor: Simulated distance measurements
- Camera: Rendered images from the robot's perspective
- IMU: Simulated orientation and acceleration data

#### Environment Simulation

The environment simulation provides a virtual world for the robot to navigate:

- Walls and obstacles
- Different room types
- Dynamic objects
- Lighting conditions

### Switching Between Simulation and Physical Hardware

The system can seamlessly switch between simulation and physical hardware using the HAL:

```python
# Launch with simulation
ros2 launch nevil_simulation nevil_system_with_simulation.launch.py

# Launch with physical hardware
ros2 launch nevil_core nevil_system.launch.py
```

## Hybrid AI Processing

### Cloud-Based Processing

Nevil-picar v2.0 uses cloud-based AI services for advanced processing:

- **OpenAI API**: Provides advanced language understanding and generation
- **High-Quality TTS**: Generates natural-sounding speech
- **Complex Reasoning**: Handles complex decision-making and planning

Example OpenAI API usage:

```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Nevil, a helpful robot assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What can you do?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Local Processing

For offline operation and low-latency tasks, Nevil-picar v2.0 uses local AI models:

- **Gemma 2 or TinyLlama**: Provides basic language understanding and generation
- **Local Speech Recognition**: Processes simple voice commands
- **Object Recognition**: Identifies objects using optimized models

Example local model usage:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2b")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2b")

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, I'm Nevil. How can I help you?", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

print(response)
```

### Seamless Switching

The system automatically switches between cloud and local processing based on:

- Network connectivity
- Task complexity
- Response time requirements

```python
def process_text(text):
    try:
        if is_complex_query(text) and is_network_available():
            return process_with_cloud_ai(text)
        else:
            return process_with_local_ai(text)
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to local processing on error
        return process_with_local_ai(text)
```

## Navigation and Mapping

### Basic Movement

Nevil-picar v2.0 provides basic movement capabilities through the Motion Control Node:

- Forward and backward movement
- Turning left and right
- Speed control
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration

These capabilities are exposed through the `/cmd_vel` topic using the `Twist` message type:

```python
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

# Move forward at 0.5 m/s
msg = Twist()
msg.linear.x = 0.5
msg.angular.z = 0.0
publisher.publish(msg)

# Turn left at 1.0 rad/s
msg = Twist()
msg.linear.x = 0.0
msg.angular.z = 1.0
publisher.publish(msg)
```

### Obstacle Avoidance

The Obstacle Avoidance Node provides real-time obstacle detection and avoidance:

- Ultrasonic sensor processing
- Obstacle detection algorithms
- Avoidance strategies
- Integration with navigation

Example obstacle avoidance logic:

```python
def obstacle_avoidance_callback(self):
    # Get distance from ultrasonic sensor
    distance = self.get_distance()
    
    # Check if obstacle is detected
    if distance < self.min_distance:
        # Create stop command
        msg = Twist()
        msg.linear.x = 0.0
        msg.angular.z = 0.0
        self.cmd_vel_publisher.publish(msg)
        
        # Initiate avoidance maneuver
        self.avoid_obstacle()
    else:
        # Continue with normal navigation
        pass
```

### SLAM Implementation

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows the robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously determining its location within that map:

- Map building and updating
- Localization within the map
- Path planning using the map
- Obstacle marking and avoidance

Example SLAM integration:

```python
def process_scan(self, scan_data):
    # Update the map with new scan data
    self.slam_processor.update_map(scan_data)
    
    # Get current position estimate
    position = self.slam_processor.get_position()
    
    # Update navigation with new map and position
    self.navigation.update(self.slam_processor.get_map(), position)
```

## Text and Voice Interfaces

### Voice Control

The Voice Control Node provides speech recognition and synthesis:

- Voice activity detection
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Intent recognition
- Text-to-speech synthesis

Example voice control flow:

```python
def voice_control_loop(self):
    while rclpy.ok():
        # Detect voice activity
        if self.detect_voice_activity():
            # Capture audio
            audio = self.capture_audio()
            
            # Convert speech to text
            text = self.speech_to_text(audio)
            
            # Process command
            response = self.process_command(text)
            
            # Convert text to speech
            self.text_to_speech(response)
```

### Text Interface

The text interface allows for command input and output through text:

- Command parsing and execution
- Text-based responses
- Logging and history
- Integration with voice interface

Example text command processing:

```python
def process_text_command(self, command):
    # Parse command
    intent, parameters = self.parse_command(command)
    
    # Execute command based on intent
    if intent == "move":
        return self.execute_move_command(parameters)
    elif intent == "turn":
        return self.execute_turn_command(parameters)
    elif intent == "stop":
        return self.execute_stop_command()
    else:
        return "I don't understand that command."
```

### Context Management

The system maintains conversation context to provide coherent interactions:

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.environment_context = {}
        self.user_profiles = {}
        self.current_mode = "conversation"
    
    def add_user_utterance(self, user_id, text):
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "id": user_id, "content": text})
    
    def add_system_response(self, text):
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": text})
    
    def update_environment(self, location, objects, room_type):
        self.environment_context.update({
            "location": location,
            "visible_objects": objects,
            "room_type": room_type
        })
    
    def get_context_for_ai(self):
        # Format context for AI processing
        return {
            "conversation": self.conversation_history[-10:],  # Last 10 exchanges
            "environment": self.environment_context,
            "mode": self.current_mode
        }
```

## System Modes

Nevil-picar v2.0 operates in several modes, each with specific behaviors and capabilities:

### Conversation Mode

In conversation mode, the robot focuses on interaction with users:

- Active listening for voice commands
- Natural language conversation
- Reduced movement to minimize noise
- Focus on user engagement

### Play Mode

In play mode, the robot explores and interacts with its environment:

- Autonomous exploration
- Object detection and tracking
- Environmental learning
- Playful behaviors and responses

### Autonomous Mode

In autonomous mode, the robot operates independently:

- SLAM-based navigation
- Environmental mapping
- Object recognition and categorization
- Self-directed behavior

### Sleep Mode

In sleep mode, the robot conserves power while maintaining awareness:

- Reduced sensor processing
- Minimal movement
- Low-power listening for wake commands
- Periodic environment checks

### Mode Switching

The system can switch between modes based on commands or context:

```python
def switch_mode(self, new_mode):
    if new_mode == "conversation":
        self.set_conversation_mode()
    elif new_mode == "play":
        self.set_play_mode()
    elif new_mode == "autonomous":
        self.set_autonomous_mode()
    elif new_mode == "sleep":
        self.set_sleep_mode()
    
    # Publish mode change
    msg = String()
    msg.data = new_mode
    self.mode_publisher.publish(msg)
```

## Testing Framework

Nevil-picar v2.0 includes a comprehensive testing framework to ensure reliable operation:

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components:

```python
def test_motion_control():
    # Create a motion control node
    node = MotionControl()
    
    # Test forward movement
    node.set_velocity(0.5, 0.0)
    assert node.current_linear_velocity == 0.5
    assert node.current_angular_velocity == 0.0
    
    # Test turning
    node.set_velocity(0.0, 1.0)
    assert node.current_linear_velocity == 0.0
    assert node.current_angular_velocity == 1.0
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interaction between components:

```python
def test_obstacle_avoidance_integration():
    # Create nodes
    motion = MotionControl()
    obstacle = ObstacleAvoidance()
    
    # Connect nodes
    obstacle.cmd_vel_publisher = motion.cmd_vel_subscription
    
    # Simulate obstacle detection
    obstacle.distance = 0.1  # Close obstacle
    obstacle.obstacle_detection_callback()
    
    # Verify motion control response
    assert motion.current_linear_velocity == 0.0  # Should stop
```

### Simulation Testing

Simulation tests verify behavior in the digital twin environment:

```python
def test_navigation_in_simulation():
    # Launch simulation
    simulation = SimulationEnvironment()
    
    # Create navigation node
    navigation = Navigation(simulation=True)
    
    # Set navigation goal
    navigation.set_goal(1.0, 2.0, 0.0)
    
    # Run simulation for 10 seconds
    simulation.run(10.0)
    
    # Verify robot reached goal
    position = simulation.get_robot_position()
    assert abs(position.x - 1.0) < 0.1
    assert abs(position.y - 2.0) < 0.1
```

### Hardware Testing

Hardware tests verify behavior on the physical robot:

```python
def test_hardware_interface():
    # Create hardware interface
    hardware = PhysicalHardwareInterface()
    
    # Test motor control
    hardware.set_motor_speed(0.5, 0.5)
    time.sleep(1.0)
    hardware.set_motor_speed(0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Test ultrasonic sensor
    distance = hardware.get_distance()
    assert distance > 0.0
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify real-time capabilities:

```python
def test_real_time_performance():
    # Create test node
    node = RealTimeTestNode()
    
    # Run test for 10 seconds
    start_time = time.time()
    latencies = []
    
    while time.time() - start_time < 10.0:
        callback_start = time.time()
        node.test_callback()
        latency = time.time() - callback_start
        latencies.append(latency)
    
    # Verify latency requirements
    max_latency = max(latencies)
    assert max_latency < 0.001  # Less than 1ms
```

## Conclusion
