```

## 3. Multi-Threading Architecture (ROS2 + PREEMPT-RT)

### 3.1 ROS2 MultiThreadedExecutor

Nevil v2.0 leverages ROS2's MultiThreadedExecutor to enable true parallel processing across nodes:

```python
def main():
    rclpy.init()
    motion = MotionControl()
    obstacle = ObstacleAvoidance()
    navigation = Navigation()
    vision = CameraVision()
    voice = VoiceControl()
    ai = AIProcessing()
    system = SystemManager()

    executor = MultiThreadedExecutor()
    executor.add_node(motion)
    executor.add_node(obstacle)
    executor.add_node(navigation)
    executor.add_node(vision)
    executor.add_node(voice)
    executor.add_node(ai)
    executor.add_node(system)

    try:
        executor.spin()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

    # Cleanup nodes
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

### 3.2 PREEMPT-RT Integration

The PREEMPT-RT patched kernel enables deterministic, low-latency performance:

1. **Kernel Configuration**:
   - PREEMPT-RT patched kernel installed on Raspberry Pi
   - Real-time scheduling policies (SCHED_FIFO) enabled
   - Power-saving features disabled to prevent latency spikes

2. **Priority-Based Scheduling**:
   - Critical nodes (obstacle avoidance, motion control) run at highest priority
   - Medium-priority nodes (navigation, vision) run at intermediate priority
   - Non-critical nodes (voice, AI) run at lower priority

3. **Launch with Priority**:
   ```python
   nodes = [
       ("nevil", "motion_control", 90),      # Highest priority
       ("nevil", "obstacle_avoidance", 85),
       ("nevil", "navigation", 80),
       ("nevil", "camera_vision", 70),
       ("nevil", "voice_control", 60),
       ("nevil", "ai_processing", 50),
       ("nevil", "system_manager", 40)       # Lowest priority
   ]

   for package, executable, priority in nodes:
       cmd = ["sudo", "chrt", "-f", str(priority), "ros2", "run", package, executable]
       subprocess.Popen(cmd)
   ```

### 3.3 Performance Metrics

- **Latency Requirements**:
  - Obstacle detection and avoidance: < 50ms
  - Motion control command execution: < 20ms
  - Voice command recognition: < 1s
  - System mode switching: < 500ms

## 4. Key Interfaces Between Components

### 4.1 action_helper.py API Integration

The action_helper.py API from v1.0 provides proven navigation capabilities that will be adapted for the ROS2 architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "v1.0 action_helper.py"
        AH1[Movement Functions] --- AH2[Obstacle Check Decorator]
        AH2 --- AH3[Expressive Behaviors]
        AH3 --- AH4[Sound Functions]
    end
    
    subgraph "v2.0 ROS2 Integration"
        R1[Motion Control Node] --- R2[Navigation Node]
        R2 --- R3[Behavior Actions]
        R3 --- R4[Audio Node]
    end
    
    AH1 -.-> R1
    AH2 -.-> R2
    AH3 -.-> R3
    AH4 -.-> R4
```

Key functions from action_helper.py will be adapted as ROS2 services and actions:

1. **Basic Movement**:
   - `move_forward_this_way` → ROS2 action with obstacle checking
   - `move_backward_this_way` → ROS2 action
   - `turn_left`, `turn_right` → ROS2 actions

2. **Expressive Behaviors**:
   - `wave_hands`, `shake_head`, `nod`, etc. → ROS2 actions

3. **Obstacle Checking**:
   - The `with_obstacle_check` decorator will be implemented as a ROS2 service that can be called by any node requiring obstacle awareness

### 4.2 ROS2 Topic/Service/Action Interfaces

| Interface Type | Name | Description | Publishers | Subscribers |
|----------------|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Topic | `/cmd_vel` | Velocity commands | Navigation, Obstacle Avoidance | Motion Control |
| Topic | `/ultrasonic_data` | Distance sensor readings | Sensor Driver | Obstacle Avoidance |
| Topic | `/camera/image_raw` | Raw camera images | Camera Driver | Camera Vision |
| Topic | `/object_detections` | Detected objects | Camera Vision | Navigation, AI Processing |
| Topic | `/system_mode` | Current system mode | System Manager | All Nodes |
| Service | `/check_obstacle` | Obstacle check service | Obstacle Avoidance | Any Node |
| Action | `/navigate_to_point` | Navigation action | Navigation | System Manager, AI Processing |
| Action | `/perform_behavior` | Expressive behavior action | Motion Control | System Manager, AI Processing |

    end
    
    HA3 --- DT1
    HA3 --- RN1
    DT3 --- RN2
    DT4 --- RN4
```

### 5.2 Hardware Abstraction Layer

A key component of the digital twin architecture is the hardware abstraction layer that allows seamless switching between simulation and physical hardware:

```python
class HardwareInterface:
    def __init__(self, simulation_mode=False):
        self.simulation_mode = simulation_mode
        if simulation_mode:
            self.interface = SimulationInterface()
        else:
            self.interface = PhysicalHardwareInterface()
    
    def set_motor_speed(self, left, right):
        return self.interface.set_motor_speed(left, right)
    
    def get_distance(self):
        return self.interface.get_distance()
    
    def get_camera_image(self):
        return self.interface.get_camera_image()
    
    # Additional hardware methods...
```

### 5.3 Simulation Environment

The simulation environment will include:

1. **URDF Model**: Accurate representation of PiCar-X physical dimensions and properties
2. **Physics Simulation**: Realistic motion dynamics and interactions
3. **Sensor Simulation**: Virtual ultrasonic, camera, and IMU sensors
4. **Environment Simulation**: Configurable test environments for navigation and SLAM testing

        A3 --- A4[Response Generation]
    end
    
    V3 --- A1
    V4 --- A3
    A4 --- V6
```

### 6.2 Hybrid AI Processing

Nevil v2.0 implements a hybrid approach to AI processing:

1. **Cloud-Based Processing (Online)**:
   - OpenAI API for advanced language understanding
   - High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
   - Complex reasoning and conversation

2. **Local Processing (Offline)**:
   - Gemma 2 or TinyLlama for basic cognition
   - Local speech recognition for command processing
   - Object recognition using optimized models

3. **Seamless Switching**:
   - Automatic fallback to local processing when offline
   - Prioritization based on task complexity
   - Caching of common responses for reduced latency

### 6.3 Conversation and Context Management

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.environment_context = {}
        self.user_profiles = {}
        self.current_mode = "conversation"
    
    def add_user_utterance(self, user_id, text):
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "id": user_id, "content": text})
    
    def add_system_response(self, text):
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": text})
    
    def update_environment(self, location, objects, room_type):
        self.environment_context.update({
            "location": location,
            "visible_objects": objects,
            "room_type": room_type
        })
    
    def get_context_for_ai(self):
        # Format context for AI processing
        return {
            "conversation": self.conversation_history[-10:],  # Last 10 exchanges
            "environment": self.environment_context,
            "mode": self.current_mode
        }
```
