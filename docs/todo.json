      "name": "Missing System Monitor",
      "type": "Bug",
      "summary": "system_monitor executable not found in libexec directory",
      "description": "The ROS2 launch system is unable to find the system_monitor executable in the expected location: '/home/dan/nevil/src/install/nevil_bringup/lib/nevil_bringup'.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n- The system_monitor.py script exists in the source directory (~/nevil/src/nevil_bringup/scripts/system_monitor.py)\n- However, it's not being installed to the lib directory during the build process\n- Only nevil_cli.py is being installed, despite the CMakeLists.txt file specifying both scripts\n\n**Current Workaround:**\n- Modified the launch file to use ExecuteProcess instead of Node\n- This bypasses the need for the executable to be in the lib directory\n- Directly runs the Python script from its source location\n\n**Pros of ExecuteProcess Approach:**\n- Simplicity: Directly executes the script without installation requirements\n- Flexibility: Can run scripts from any location, not just installed locations\n- Development Friendly: Easier to test changes without rebuilding/reinstalling\n- No Build Dependencies: Works regardless of build system configuration\n- Quick Fix: Immediate solution without modifying build files\n\n**Cons of ExecuteProcess Approach:**\n- Non-Standard: Doesn't follow ROS2 best practices\n- Limited Lifecycle Management: Doesn't integrate with ROS2 node lifecycle\n- Manual Parameter Handling: Parameters must be passed as command-line arguments\n- Namespace Issues: May require manual namespace configuration\n- Resource Management: Less controlled termination and cleanup\n\n**Permanent Solution Options:**\n1. Fix the build system to properly install system_monitor.py to the lib directory\n2. Create a proper entry point in setup.py for the system_monitor script",
