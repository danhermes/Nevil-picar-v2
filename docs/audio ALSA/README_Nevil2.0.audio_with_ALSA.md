# ? Nevil v2.0 Audio System ? README

## ? Summary

Nevil?s audio system is a minimal, robust pipeline dedicated to one job: **text-to-speech output from OpenAI**, routed through a HiFiBerry DAC and played via the `robot_hat` audio chain. The system does *not* rely on PulseAudio, PipeWire, or `aplay`. This choice ensures tight hardware control, low overhead, and fewer interference points on a dedicated robotics OS (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm).

---

## ? Purpose

Nevil speaks using OpenAI's TTS engine (via API), saves MP3 files, and plays them through a HiFiBerry DAC via the `robot_hat.Music()` class, which uses `pygame.mixer` under the hood. This pipeline:
- Minimizes dependencies.
- Avoids complex Linux audio layers like PipeWire or PulseAudio.
- Gives priority access to hardware.
- Reuses the proven Nevil 1.0 method.

## ? Audio Stack Components

| Layer              | Role                                           | Notes                                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **HiFiBerry DAC** | Hardware audio output                          | I2S-based, card index 3 on ALSA                          |
| **robot_hat.Music**| Plays audio files via `pygame.mixer`          | Light wrapper; uses DAC directly                         |
| **OpenAI TTS**    | Generates MP3 speech from text                 | Output file saved and fed into music player              |
| **PyAudio**       | Initialized but not actively used in playback  | Reserved for future mic input (STT)                      |
| **pygame.mixer**  | Underneath `robot_hat.Music`                   | Handles actual sound playback                            |

## ? What We Avoided (on Purpose)

| System Component | Reason for Avoidance                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `aplay`          | Low-level test tool, didn?t support our DAC config |
| `alsamixer`      | Broken when ALSA was misconfigured               |
| `PulseAudio`     | Overkill, auto-spawns, hard to control cleanly   |
| `PipeWire`       | Not mature/stable enough on Pi for this use case |
| `ALSA default card` | Unreliable on Pi with I2S DACs + USB audio    |

---

## ? What Broke & Why

- **`aplay`** failed with `device busy` and `channel not available` because the DAC is a 2-channel stereo device and `aplay` was trying mono by default.
- **`alsamixer`** broke due to missing or mis-indexed default cards.
- **ALSA config** wasn?t wrong, but also wasn?t respected?PipeWire/Pulse can override ALSA indices.
- **PipeWire** was partially removed but left enough system debris to confuse service restarts.
- **Rebooting and testing directly with `robot_hat.Music` worked perfectly** ? confirming hardware was fine.

---

## ? What Works Now (and Why)

- The audio interface plays TTS via **OpenAI ? local MP3 ? `robot_hat.Music()` ? HiFiBerry DAC**.
- `robot_hat.Music.music_play()` handles decoding and playing audio files directly.
- The HiFiBerry DAC is set to ALSA index 3, but that?s irrelevant ? `robot_hat` speaks to the hardware.
- `pygame.mixer` uses the ALSA back end directly via the correct card.

---

## ? Config Files & System Setup

### `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`

Ensures HiFiBerry DAC takes card index 0 or 3 and suppresses HDMI/USB devices:

```bash
options snd slots=sndrpihifiberry
options sndrpihifiberry index=0
options snd_usb_audio index=-2
options snd_hda_intel index=-2
```

*Note:* May not reflect actual card assignment due to dynamic loading. Doesn?t matter for our usage.

---

### `i2samp.sh` (Boot-Time Audio Init Script)

Ensures correct GPIO, I2S, and mixer state for HiFiBerry. Run at boot or via systemd.

---

## ? Tools to Maintain Audio

Use only these tools for testing and maintenance:

### 1. `robot_hat.Music` (Primary Player)
Used in your code. If it plays an MP3, you?re good.

### 2. `pygame.mixer`
Optionally test manually:
```python
import pygame
pygame.mixer.init()
pygame.mixer.music.load("test.mp3")
pygame.mixer.music.play()
while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():
    pass
```

### 3. `cat /proc/asound/cards`
Lists detected audio cards. HiFiBerry DAC should appear as `sndrpihifiberry`.

### 4. `sudo fuser -v /dev/snd/*`
Shows which process is blocking the audio device, if anything fails.

---

## ? Reset & Recovery

If sound fails:

1. **Reboot**.
2. Re-run `i2samp.sh`.
3. Use `fuser` to kill zombie processes holding `/dev/snd/*`.
4. Confirm with a known MP3 using `robot_hat.Music` or `pygame`.

Avoid running `aplay`, `alsamixer`, or manually poking `/dev/snd` if not needed.

---

## ? Final Verdict

**You don?t need to fix ALSA or install PipeWire.**

Your speaker works exactly as needed through a lean, dedicated pipeline:

### burn_pipewire_to_the_ground.sh Summary

The `burn_to_the_ground.sh` script was a full scorched-earth policy targeting *every modern audio subsystem* that might interfere with a clean, ALSA-only setup.

It did the following:

1. **Purged PipeWire and Friends**
   It ran:

   ```bash
   sudo apt purge -y pipewire wireplumber pipewire-audio-client-libraries
   ```

   That wiped out the entire PipeWire stack, including the session manager (WirePlumber) and any client libraries apps might use to route sound through PipeWire.

2. **Removed PulseAudio if present**
   While not explicitly in that script, it?s assumed `pulseaudio` was already gone or incompatible.

3. **Disabled any lingering services**
   PipeWire services were likely masked or removed, and no other session managers were started.

4. **Left ALSA naked and alone**
   ALSA was now the only game in town?but not happily configured. It was set to look at the HiFiBerry DAC (`card 3`) based on what you found in `/proc/asound/cards`, and entries in `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`.

5. **Didn't touch .asoundrc**
   This left default audio resolution brittle. Tools like `aplay` choked unless invoked with full device names. `alsamixer` complained about missing default card setups. In short: the plumbing was gone, but the faucets hadn?t been rerouted.

---

### Net Effect

* Nevil?s **own pipeline** (OpenAI TTS ? MP3 ? `robot_hat.Music.music_play()`) continued to work because it **bypasses ALSA** and uses `pygame` or internal methods.
* **`aplay` is broken** unless you specify exact formats that the card supports.
* **`alsamixer` can?t find default card**, because the `default` device is unset or pointing at HDMI or nothing at all.
* But crucially: **Nevil speaks**. Mission-almost-accomplished.
